This repository aims to exhibit and narrow down an issue with npm workspaces, where running `npm install` to install
a new dependency in a workspace that already depends on another local package.

## Steps to reproduce

- Navigate to a workspace: `cd scoped/workspace-b` or `cd unscoped/workspace-b`
- Try to install a dependency: `npm install left-pad`

## Current Behaviour

### Using scoped packages

```
$ …/scoped/workspace-b > npm install left-pad
npm ERR! code E404
npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@foo%2fworkspace-a - Not found
npm ERR! 404
npm ERR! 404  '@foo/workspace-a@0.0.1' is not in the npm registry.
npm ERR! 404 You should bug the author to publish it (or use the name yourself!)
npm ERR! 404
npm ERR! 404 Note that you can also install from a
npm ERR! 404 tarball, folder, http url, or git url.
```

### Using unscoped packages

Slightly different error, but identical result with unscoped packages:
```
$ …/unscoped/workspace-b > npm install left-pad
npm ERR! code ETARGET
npm ERR! notarget No matching version found for workspace-a@0.0.1.
npm ERR! notarget In most cases you or one of your dependencies are requesting
npm ERR! notarget a package version that doesn't exist.
```

## Expected Behaviour

The new dependency I am trying to install should be installed with no errors and local depenencies present in the same
mono-repo and registered as workspaces should be identified and linked correctly.

### How does Yarn handle this?

For comparison, Yarn is able to handle this situation just fine; running `yarn add left-pad` inside `workspace-b`
succeeds and the local dependency on `workspace-a` is correctly resolved. The resulting project state can be seen on the
[`yarn` branch](https://github.com/raphaelsaunier/npm-install-in-workspace-issue/tree/yarn) of this repository.

```
$ …/unscoped/workspace-b > yarn add left-pad
yarn add v1.22.10
